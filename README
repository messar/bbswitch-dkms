A kernel module that enables you to call ACPI methods by writing the method
name followed by arguments to /proc/acpi/call.

Usage:

    echo '<call>' | sudo tee /proc/acpi/call
You can then retrieve the result of the call by checking your dmesg or:

    sudo cat /proc/acpi/call

You can pass parameters to acpi_call by writing them after the method,
separated by single space. Currently, you can pass the following parameter
types:
* ACPI_INTEGER - by writing NNN or 0xNNN, where NNN is an integer/hex
* ACPI_STRING - by enclosing the string in quotes: "hello, world"
* ACPI_BUFFER - by writing bXXXX, where XXXX is a hex string without spaces,
                or by writing { b1, b2, b3, b4 }, where b1-4 are integers

The status after a call can be read back from /proc/acpi/call:
* 'not called' - nothing to report
* 'Error: <description>' - the call failed
* '0xNN' - the call succeeded, and returned an integer
* '"..."' - the call succeeded, and returned a string
* '{0xNN, ...}' - the call succeeded, and returned a buffer
